 **Goal:** Find the trash compactor to free the Rebels.
 
 After the *Millennium Falcon's* capture on the Death Star, Han Solo and Luke Skywalker ambush a pair of Stormtroopers, steal their uniforms and police the ship to locate a detained Princess Leia. R2-D2 and C-3PO are told to watch the *Millennium Falcon*. When Luke, Han and Leia escape the detention cell, but end up in the trash compactor, R2-D2 is summoned to help them escape!
 
 You will use your finger to guide R2-D2 through the Death Star. Complete the `onTouch` function to move R2-D2 in the correct direction. `onTouch` has two parameters. `distance` is how far your finger is away from R2-D2 and `angle` is the angle between where R2-D2 is facing and your finger. First check if `distance` is large enough to start a roll command. Then check compare `angle` to `angleThreshold` to determine if you should call `moveForward`, `turnLeft`, or `turnRight`.
