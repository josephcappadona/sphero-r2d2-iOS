 **Goal:** Hide from Stormtroopers.
 
 Stormtroopers are on patrol in this sector. R2-D2 detects the Stormtroopers as they approach, helping it avoid detection on its way to the trash compactor.
 
 Complete `stormtrooperNearby` to make R2-D2 react to nearby Stormtroopers. The `distance` variable will confirm how close the nearest Stormtrooper is to R2-D2. If there are no Stormtroopers nearby, R2-D2 should play a happy sound. If a Stormtrooper is approaching, R2-D2 should play a scared sound. If a Stormtrooper is in very close proximity, R2-D2 should begin waddling.
