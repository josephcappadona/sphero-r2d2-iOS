 **Goal:** Warn Luke of the nearby danger.
 
 R2-D2's travels are deterred when the Droid is captured by Jawas and sold to Luke Skywalker and his Uncle Owen Lars. R2-D2 escapes in the night to continue the search for Obi-Wan Kenobi. When Luke and C-3PO discover R2-D2 is missing, they search the Tatooine sands, only to be followed by Sand People.
 
 R2-D2 hopes to warn Luke of the Tusken Raiders lurking in his path. Use the `setStance` function to make R2-D2 waddle and play a scared sound to alert Luke to danger.
